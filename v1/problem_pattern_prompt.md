"I have the following list of LeetCode problems: 
[

].

Please organize these problems into groups based on common problem-solving patterns or techniques relevant to coding interviews (e.g., arrays and hashing, two pointers, sliding window, binary search, dynamic programming, graphs, trees, backtracking, greedy, etc.). The goal is to create a structured study plan to master these patterns for technical interviews.

For each group, provide:
1. **Pattern Name**: Clearly state the pattern (e.g., 'Two Pointers').
2. **Brief Explanation**: Describe the pattern in 2-3 sentences, highlighting its core concept and typical use cases.
3. **Relevant Problems**: List the problems from the provided list that fit this pattern, including the problem name and a direct hyperlink to the LeetCode problem page (e.g., 'Two Sum: https://leetcode.com/problems/two-sum/').
4. **Interview Relevance**: Explain in 1-2 sentences why this pattern is valuable for coding interviews.
5. **Practice Tips**: Suggest 1-2 practical strategies for mastering this pattern (e.g., key techniques to focus on or follow-up problems to explore).

If a problem fits multiple patterns, place it in the most relevant group and note any secondary patterns. If any problems donâ€™t fit a clear pattern, group them under 'Miscellaneous' with a brief explanation. Present the output in a clear, structured format (e.g., bullet points, numbered lists, or a table) for easy reference. Ensure all hyperlinks are accurate and point to the correct LeetCode problem pages."
