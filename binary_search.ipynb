    "# Binary Search: Understanding and Application\n",
    "\n",
    "## Binary Search\n",
    "Binary Search is conceptually straightforward. It splits the search space into two halves, keeping only the half that potentially contains the target, and discards the other half. This process reduces the search space by half at each step, changing the time complexity from linear (O(n)) to logarithmic (O(log n)). However, implementing a bug-free version can be challenging. Common issues include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Loop exit condition:** Should we use `left < right` or `left <= right`?\n",
    "- **Boundary initialization:** How to initialize `left` and `right`?\n",
    "- **Boundary updates:** Should we use `left = mid`, `left = mid + 1`, `right = mid`, or `right = mid - 1`?\n",
    "\n",
    "A common misconception is that binary search is only applicable for simple problems like finding a specific value in a sorted array. In fact, it can be applied to much more complex scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Generalized Binary Search Template\n",
    "\n",
    "Binary search often focuses on the following task:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Minimize \\(k\\), such that `condition(k)` is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the template:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def binary_search(array) -> int:\n",
    "    def condition(value) -> bool:\n",
    "        pass  # Define the condition logic\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Initialize boundaries for the search space\n",
    "    # Define the search space\n",
    "    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space)\n",
    "    # Continue until the search space is narrowed down to one element\n",
    "    while left < right:\n",
    "        # Calculate the middle index to prevent overflow\n",
    "        mid = left + (right - left) // 2  \n",
    "        if condition(mid):  # If condition is met, shrink the right boundary\n",
    "            right = mid\n",
    "        else:  # If condition is not met, shrink the left boundary\n",
    "            left = mid + 1\n",
    "    return left  # Return the smallest k that satisfies the condition\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points\n",
    "1. **Initialize boundaries:** Define `left` and `right` to include all possible values in the search space.\n",
    "2. **Return value:** After exiting the loop, `left` is the minimal \\(k\\) satisfying `condition(k)`. Adjust return value as needed.\n",
    "3. **Condition function:** This is the core logic and often the hardest part to define."

    "The line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "sum((pile - 1) // speed + 1 for pile in piles) <= H\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "is a compact way of calculating how many hours it will take for Koko to eat all the bananas at a given eating speed (`speed`), and then checking if that total time is within the allowed hours (`H`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Explanation of the Formula:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **For each pile:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   (pile - 1) // speed + 1\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **`pile`**: The number of bananas in the current pile.\n",
    "   - **`speed`**: The number of bananas Koko can eat in one hour.\n",
    "   - **`(pile - 1) // speed`**: This computes the integer division of `(pile - 1)` by `speed`. It effectively gives the number of full hours required if there were `pile - 1` bananas.\n",
    "   - **`+ 1`**: Adds 1 more hour to account for the remainder, i.e., any leftover bananas in the pile that do not complete a full hour of eating.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Together, this calculates the total number of hours needed for Koko to finish the pile at the current `speed`.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   - If `pile = 30` and `speed = 23`:\n",
    "     - `(30 - 1) // 23 + 1 = 29 // 23 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **`sum((pile - 1) // speed + 1 for pile in piles)`**:\n",
    "   This calculates the total number of hours required to finish all piles at the current eating speed by summing the hours for each pile.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`<= H`**:\n",
    "   This checks if the total hours required is less than or equal to the allowed time `H`. If true, it means that the speed `speed` is feasible because Koko can finish all the bananas within `H` hours at this speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why This Formula Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "- It avoids the overhead of using `math.ceil(pile / speed)`, which could be slower for large inputs because it involves floating-point arithmetic.\n",
    "- Instead, `(pile - 1) // speed + 1` computes the same result using integer arithmetic, which is faster and avoids precision issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Walkthrough:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "piles = [30, 11, 23, 4, 20]\n",
    "speed = 10\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "1. For `pile = 30`: `(30 - 1) // 10 + 1 = 29 // 10 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 hours`.\n",
    "2. For `pile = 11`: `(11 - 1) // 10 + 1 = 10 // 10 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 hours`.\n",
    "3. For `pile = 23`: `(23 - 1) // 10 + 1 = 22 // 10 + 1 = 2 + 1 = 3 hours`.\n",
    "4. For `pile = 4`: `(4 - 1) // 10 + 1 = 3 // 10 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1 hour`.\n",
    "5. For `pile = 20`: `(20 - 1) // 10 + 1 = 19 // 10 + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 hours`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Total Hours = 3 + 2 + 3 + 1 + 2 = 11 hours**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If `H = 11`, this speed is feasible. If `H < 11`, this speed is too slow, and we need to increase the speed."
