    "## [1. K Closest Points to Origin (Medium)](https://leetcode.com/problems/k-closest-points-to-origin/)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Problem Statement:\n",
    "Given an array of points where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the **X-Y** plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin `(0, 0)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (not squared):  \n",
    "**[text{Distance} = sqrt{(xi - 0)^2 + (yi - 0)^2}]**\n",
    "\n",
    "You may return the answer in **any order**. The answer is **guaranteed** to be unique (i.e., there will not be multiple points at the same distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Sample Input and Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 1:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1\n",
    "Output: [[-2,2]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The distance of the point (1, 3) from the origin is sqrt(10).\n",
    "The distance of the point (-2, 2) from the origin is sqrt(8).\n",
    "Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), the closest point is [-2, 2].\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example 2:**\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2\n",
    "Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]\n",
    "Explanation:\n",
    "The distance of the points from the origin are:\n",
    "(3, 3) -> sqrt(18)\n",
    "(5, -1) -> sqrt(26)\n",
    "(-2, 4) -> sqrt(20)\n",
    "The two closest points are (3, 3) and (-2, 4).\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Notes:\n",
    "- The output points can be in any order, as long as they are among the `k` closest.\n"
