    "     - Output: `True`\n",
    "     - Input: `\"abcd\"`\n",
    "     - Output: `False`\n",
    "\n",

    "2. **Create a Word Map**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   word_map = {word: i for i, word in enumerate(words)}\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - This creates a dictionary (`word_map`) where each word is mapped to its index. It allows **quick lookups** of a word's index.\n",

    "     ```python\n",
    "     word_map = {\n",

    "       prefix = word[:j]\n",
    "       suffix = word[j:]\n",

    "   - Why the condition `j != n`? To avoid duplicate checks when `suffix` is an empty string.\n",

    "   - For `word = \"lls\"` (`i = 2`):\n",
    "     - `prefix = \"ll\"`, `suffix = \"s\"`\n",
    "     - `suffix` is a palindrome.\n",
