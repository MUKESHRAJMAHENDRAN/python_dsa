## 🎯 Core Patterns Identified in This Chunk:
1. **Two Pointers** (with dummy node or fast/slow)
2. **Pointer Rewiring** (reversing, reordering, splitting linked lists)
3. **Fast/Slow Pointers** (cycle detection, middle finding)
4. **Dummy Node Technique** (clean traversal and manipulation)
5. **Hash Map + Doubly Linked List** (for LRU Cache — advanced but critical)

## 🧠 Pattern 1: Two Pointers (with Dummy Node)

### ✅ How to Recognize
- You're working with a **linked list** and need to traverse it efficiently.
- Common use cases:
  - Merging two sorted lists
  - Removing nodes from end (e.g., Nth from end)
  - Swapping adjacent nodes
- Look for phrases like:
  - "Remove the nth node from the end"
  - "Merge two sorted lists"
  - "Swap every two adjacent nodes"

### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (Recipe)
1. Use a **dummy head** to avoid edge case handling (e.g., removing the first node).
2. Initialize two pointers: `left` and `right`.
3. Position them appropriately (e.g., `right` starts at `head`, `left` at dummy).
4. Move one pointer ahead by N steps (if needed).
5. Move both pointers until `right` reaches the end.
6. Now `left.next` is the node to remove/edit.
7. Perform the required operation (update `next`, reverse links, etc.).

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Forgetting to return `dummy.next` instead of `head`.
- Not handling empty list (`head == None`).
- Off-by-one errors when counting from end.
- Not updating `prev` correctly during rewiring.


## 🧠 Pattern 2: Fast/Slow Pointers (Floyd’s Cycle Detection)

### ✅ How to Recognize
- Problem asks about:
  - Finding the **middle** of a linked list.
  - Detecting a **cycle**.
  - Determining if a list has a loop.
- Key phrase: “find the middle”, “detect cycle”, “loop”.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (Recipe)
1. Initialize two pointers: `slow = head`, `fast = head`.
2. Move `fast` two steps per iteration, `slow` one step.
3. When `fast` hits the end (`fast == None` or `fast.next == None`), `slow` is at the middle.
4. For cycle detection:
   - If `fast` meets `slow` again → cycle exists.
   - Otherwise, no cycle.

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- `fast` might be `None` before `fast.next`, so check `fast and fast.next`.
- Don’t forget to reset pointers after detecting cycle.
- In some variants (like reorder), you must reverse the second half properly.

## 🧠 Pattern 3: Pointer Rewiring (Manual Link Manipulation)

### ✅ How to Recognize
- You’re asked to:
  - Reverse a sublist.
  - Swap pairs.
  - Reorder nodes (odd/even split).
  - Split and merge lists.
- The solution requires manually changing `.next` pointers.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (Recipe)
1. Use temporary variables to store references (`prev`, `curr`, `nxt`).
2. Traverse while saving next node before modifying current.
3. Update `current.next = previous`.
4. Move `previous` and `current` forward.
5. Be careful not to lose the chain.

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Losing reference to the rest of the list.
- Not returning the new head (especially after reversal).
- Misplacing `prev` or `head` after loops.

## 🧠 Pattern 4: Dummy Node Technique

### ✅ How to Recognize
- You’re doing operations that may affect the **head** of the list.
- Examples: insertion, deletion, merging.
- Avoids writing special logic for head changes.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (Recipe)
1. Create a dummy node: `dummy = ListNode(0)`.
2. Set `dummy.next = head`.
3. Use `cur = dummy` as the working pointer.
4. After all operations, return `dummy.next`.

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Forgetting to return `dummy.next`.
- Using `dummy` directly instead of `dummy.next`.

## 🧠 Pattern 5: Hash Map + Doubly Linked List (LRU Cache)

### ✅ How to Recognize
- You’re implementing an **LRU (Least Recently Used)** cache.
- Need to support `get(key)` and `put(key, value)` in O(1).
- Must maintain order of usage.

### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (Recipe)
1. Use a **hash map** to store `{key: node}` for O(1) access.
2. Use a **doubly linked list** to maintain order:
   - Most recently used at front.
   - Least recently used at back.
3. On `get`:
   - If key exists → move node to front.
   - Return value.
4. On `put`:
   - If key exists → update and move to front.
   - Else add new node to front.
   - If size > capacity → remove tail node.
5. Maintain helper methods: `add_to_front(node)`, `remove_node(node)`, `pop_tail()`.

### ⚠️ Pitfalls & Edge Cases
- Forgetting to remove old node before adding new one.
- Not updating hash map on removal.
- Handling empty cache.
- Double-checking `self.capacity` vs actual size.

### 1. [Merge Two Sorted Lists](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-two-sorted-lists/)

### ✅ **Problem Summary**
You are given two **sorted linked lists**, and you need to merge them into a single sorted linked list.

- Input: Two `ListNode` heads (`list1`, `list2`)
- Output: A new sorted linked list containing all nodes from both input lists.

> Example:  
> `list1 = [1,2,4]`, `list2 = [1,3,4]` → `merged = [1,1,2,3,4,4]`

#### 🔗 Pattern(s)
- Two Pointers (with Dummy Node)

#### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
    # Create a dummy node to simplify pointer management
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    # 'tail' points to the last node in merged list
    tail = dummy
    
    # While both lists are non-empty
    while list1 and list2:
        # Compare values; attach smaller one
        if list1.val < list2.val:
            tail.next = list1
            list1 = list1.next
        else:
            tail.next = list2
            list2 = list2.next
        # Move tail forward
        tail = tail.next
    
    # Attach remaining nodes (one list might be non-empty)
    if list1:
        tail.next = list1
    elif list2:
        tail.next = list2
    
    # Return the merged list (skip dummy)
    return dummy.next


# ---- Official LeetCode Example ----
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example Input: list1 = [1,2,4], list2 = [1,3,4]
    l1 = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(4)))
    l2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(3, ListNode(4)))

    # Call function
    merged = mergeTwoLists(l1, l2)

    # Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4]
    result = []
    while merged:
        result.append(merged.val)
        merged = merged.next
    print("Output:", result)  # Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

### 🔹 What is `ListNode`?
A simple node in a singly linked list:
- `val`: stores the value.
- `next`: points to the next node (or `None` if it's the last).

---

### 🔹 Function Definition

```python
def mergeTwoLists(list1, list2):
```

This function takes two head nodes of sorted linked lists and returns the head of the merged sorted list.

---

### 🔹 1. Create a Dummy Node

```python
dummy = ListNode(0)
tail = dummy
```

- **Why?** To avoid handling edge cases like empty lists or inserting the first node.
- `dummy` is a **fake head** that helps us build the result without worrying about where the real head goes.
- `tail` keeps track of the last node we added — so we can append new nodes easily.

> Think of `dummy` as a "placeholder" at the front. The actual result starts at `dummy.next`.

---

### 🔹 2. While Both Lists Are Non-Empty

```python
while list1 and list2:
```

We compare the current values of both lists.

#### ➤ Compare & Attach Smaller Value

```python
if list1.val < list2.val:
    tail.next = list1
    list1 = list1.next
else:
    tail.next = list2
    list2 = list2.next
```

- If `list1.val < list2.val`, attach `list1` to `tail.next`.
- Then move `list1` forward (`list1 = list1.next`).
- Otherwise, do the same for `list2`.

> This ensures the merged list stays sorted.

#### ➤ Move `tail` Forward

```python
tail = tail.next
```

After attaching a node, update `tail` to point to the newly added node.

> Now `tail` will be ready to receive the next node.

---

### 🔹 3. Handle Remaining Nodes

```python
if list1:
    tail.next = list1
elif list2:
    tail.next = list2
```

At this point, one of the lists is exhausted. But the other may still have remaining nodes.

Since both lists were already sorted, we can just **append the rest** of the non-empty list directly.

> No need to compare anymore!

---

### 🔹 4. Return Merged List

```python
return dummy.next
```

- `dummy.next` is the **first real node** in our merged list.
- We skip the dummy node because it was only used for convenience.

---

## 🎯 Example Execution: `[1,2,4]` and `[1,3,4]`

Let’s trace this manually:

### Initial State:

```text
list1: 1 → 2 → 4 → None
list2: 1 → 3 → 4 → None
dummy: 0 → ? 
tail → points to dummy
```

---

### Iteration 1: `list1.val == 1`, `list2.val == 1`

- Equal → go to `else`: attach `list2`
- `tail.next = list2` → now `tail` points to first `1` from `list2`
- Move `list2` → `list2` now points to `3`
- Move `tail` → now `tail` points to the first `1` (from list2)

> Current merged: `0 → 1` (from list2), then `1 → 3 → 4`

---

### Iteration 2: `list1.val == 1`, `list2.val == 3`

- `1 < 3` → attach `list1`
- `tail.next = list1` → add second `1`
- Move `list1` → now `list1` points to `2`
- Move `tail` → now `tail` points to this `1`

> Merged: `0 → 1 → 1 → 2 → ...`

---

### Iteration 3: `list1.val == 2`, `list2.val == 3`

- `2 < 3` → attach `list1`
- Add `2`, move `list1` → now `list1` points to `4`
- Move `tail`

> Merged: `0 → 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ...`

---

### Iteration 4: `list1.val == 4`, `list2.val == 3`

- `4 > 3` → attach `list2`
- Add `3`, move `list2` → now `list2` points to `4`
- Move `tail`

> Merged: `... → 3 → 4`

---

### Iteration 5: `list1.val == 4`, `list2.val == 4`

- Equal → attach `list2` (arbitrary choice due to `else`)
- Add `4`, move `list2` → now `list2` is `None`
- Move `tail`

Now `list2` is done.

---

### Exit Loop: `list1` still has `4`, `list2` is `None`

So we run:

```python
if list1:
    tail.next = list1
```

→ Append remaining `4` from `list1`.

Final merged list:

```text
0 → 1 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 4 → None
```

Return `dummy.next` → which is the first `1`.

---

## ✅ Final Output

```python
result = []
while merged:
    result.append(merged.val)
    merged = merged.next
print("Output:", result)  # [1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

✅ Matches expected output.

---

## 💡 Key Insights

| Feature | Purpose |
|-------|--------|
| `dummy` node | Avoids special case handling for the first insertion |
| `tail` pointer | Keeps track of where to append next node |
| Linear traversal | O(m + n) time complexity, optimal |
| Stable merge | Equal elements handled correctly (e.g., `1 == 1`) |

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time:** O(m + n) – each node visited once.
- **Space:** O(1) – only using pointers, not extra data structures (excluding output).

> Note: The returned list uses new nodes (not modifying inputs), so it’s **not** in-place.

---

## ✅ Summary

The algorithm elegantly merges two sorted linked lists using:
- A **dummy head** to simplify logic,
- A **two-pointer technique**,
- And direct appending of leftovers.

---

🎯 **Pro Tip**: Always consider using a `dummy` node when building linked lists dynamically — it reduces code complexity and avoids edge-case bugs!

### 2. [Linked List Cycle](https://leetcode.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)

#### 🔍 **Problem Overview**
We are given a singly linked list and need to determine if it contains a **cycle** — meaning some node points back to a previous node, forming a loop.

- If there is a cycle → return `True`
- If no cycle → return `False`

The algorithm uses **two pointers**:
- `slow`: moves 1 step at a time
- `fast`: moves 2 steps at a time

If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually "lap" the slow pointer inside the loop.

---

#### 🔗 Pattern(s)
- Fast/Slow Pointers

#### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def hasCycle(head):
    # Handle empty list
    if not head or not head.next:
        return False
    
    # Initialize slow and fast pointers
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    # Move slow by 1 step, fast by 2 steps
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
        # If they meet, there's a cycle
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    
    # If fast reaches end, no cycle
    return False


# ---- Official LeetCode Example ----
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1 (cycle to node with value 2)
    # Create nodes
    node0 = ListNode(3)
    node1 = ListNode(2)
    node2 = ListNode(0)
    node3 = ListNode(-4)
    
    # Link them
    node0.next = node1
    node1.next = node2
    node2.next = node3
    node3.next = node1  # creates cycle back to node1 (pos=1)

    # Check for cycle
    print("Has Cycle:", hasCycle(node0))  # Output: True
```


---


## ✅ Step-by-Step Code Walkthrough

### 🧱 1. Define the ListNode Class
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```
This defines a node with a value (`val`) and a reference to the next node (`next`).

---

### 🔄 2. The `hasCycle(head)` Function

#### ➤ Handle Edge Cases
```python
if not head or not head.next:
    return False
```
- If the list is empty (`head is None`) or has only one node, it **cannot** form a cycle.
- So we return `False`.

> ✅ This avoids unnecessary processing.

---

#### ➤ Initialize Pointers
```python
slow = head
fast = head
```
Both pointers start at the beginning of the list.

---

#### ➤ Loop: Move Pointers
```python
while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
```
- `slow` moves one step forward.
- `fast` moves two steps forward.
- We check `fast and fast.next` to ensure `fast.next` exists before accessing `fast.next.next`.

> ⚠️ Why check `fast.next`? Because `fast.next.next` would cause an error if `fast.next` is `None`.

---

#### ➤ Check for Meeting Point
```python
if slow == fast:
    return True
```
- If the two pointers meet at any point, that means there is a **cycle**.
- This is because the fast pointer is moving faster and can only catch up to the slow pointer if they're both in a loop.

> 🎯 Key Insight: In a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually "lap" the slow pointer.

---

#### ➤ No Cycle Detected
```python
return False
```
- If `fast` reaches the end (`fast is None` or `fast.next is None`), then there’s no cycle.

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

### Given Input:
```python
head = [3, 2, 0, -4], pos = 1
```
That means:
- Node 0: `3` → points to node 1
- Node 1: `2` → points to node 2
- Node 2: `0` → points to node 3
- Node 3: `-4` → points back to **node 1** (i.e., cycle starts at index 1)

So the structure looks like:

```
3 → 2 → 0 → -4
     ↑       |
     └───────┘
```

Now let’s simulate the algorithm.

---

### 🕐 Simulation Step-by-Step

| Step | `slow` | `fast` | Notes |
|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Start | `node0 (3)` | `node0 (3)` | Both start at head |
| 1 | `node1 (2)` | `node2 (0)` | slow: +1, fast: +2 |
| 2 | `node2 (0)` | `node1 (2)` | slow: +1, fast: +2 (from node2 → node3 → node1) |
| 3 | `node3 (-4)` | `node2 (0)` | slow: +1, fast: +2 (node1 → node2 → node3) |
| 4 | `node1 (2)` | `node1 (2)` | slow: +1 (node3 → node1), fast: +2 (node2 → node3 → node1) |

👉 At **step 4**, `slow == fast` → both are at `node1`.

✅ **They meet!** → Return `True`

---

## 📌 Final Output
```bash
Has Cycle: True
```

Which matches expected behavior.

---

## ✅ Why Does This Work?

- In a **non-cyclic** list: `fast` will reach the end first → loop exits → return `False`.
- In a **cyclic** list: `fast` runs in a loop and will eventually catch up to `slow` (since it's faster).
- The meeting point doesn’t matter — just the fact that they meet proves a cycle exists.

> 💡 Time Complexity: O(n) – worst case, fast goes around the loop a few times.
> 
> Space Complexity: O(1) – only two pointers used.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Feature | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| Algorithm | Floyd’s Cycle Detection (Tortoise & Hare) |
| Logic | Fast pointer moves twice as fast; if they meet, cycle exists |
| Efficiency | Optimal: O(n) time, O(1) space |
| Use Case | Detecting cycles in linked lists (LeetCode #141) |

        curr.next = prev
        prev = curr
        curr = nxt
    
    return prev
```

Let’s go through this **step-by-step**, tracking `prev`, `curr`, and `nxt`.

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Initial State:
```
prev = None
curr = 1 (head)
nxt = not yet assigned
```

List looks like:
```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 1:
- `nxt = curr.next` → `nxt = 2`
- `curr.next = prev` → `1.next = None`  
  Now: `1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 1`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 2`

Now:
```
prev = 1 → None
curr = 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 2:
- `nxt = curr.next` → `nxt = 3`
- `curr.next = prev` → `2.next = 1`  
  Now: `2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 2`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 3`

Now:
```
prev = 2 → 1 → None
curr = 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 3:
- `nxt = 3.next` → `nxt = 4`
- `curr.next = prev` → `3.next = 2`  
  Now: `3 → 2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 3`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 4`

Now:
```
prev = 3 → 2 → 1 → None
curr = 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 4:
- `nxt = 4.next` → `nxt = 5`
- `curr.next = prev` → `4.next = 3`  
  Now: `4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 4`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 5`

Now:
```
prev = 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None
curr = 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 5:
- `nxt = 5.next` → `nxt = None`
- `curr.next = prev` → `5.next = 4`  
  Now: `5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 5`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = None`

Now loop ends because `curr` is `None`.

---

### ✅ Final Result:
Return `prev`, which is now pointing to **node 5** — the new head!

```
5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None
```

✅ Success! The list is reversed.

---

### 📤 Output Section (in main block):

```python
new_head = reverseList(head)

result = []
while new_head:
    result.append(new_head.val)
    new_head = new_head.next
print("Output:", result)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

- We traverse the reversed list starting from `new_head = 5`.
- Append values: `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`.
- Print: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

### ✅ Key Points of Algorithm

| Concept | Explanation |
|-------|-------------|
| **Three Pointers** | `prev`, `curr`, `nxt` keep track of nodes during reversal. |
| **Break & Re-link** | `curr.next = prev` reverses direction. |
| **Move Forward** | Update `prev = curr`, `curr = nxt`. |
| **Time Complexity** | O(n): visit each node once. |
| **Space Complexity** | O(1): only using constant extra space. |

### 💡 Visual Summary (After Each Step)

```
Initial:     1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
Step 1:      1 ← 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None   (prev=1, curr=2)
Step 2:      1 ← 2 ← 3 → 4 → 5 → None   (prev=2, curr=3)
Step 3:      1 ← 2 ← 3 ← 4 → 5 → None   (prev=3, curr=4)
Step 4:      1 ← 2 ← 3 ← 4 ← 5 → None   (prev=4, curr=5)
Final:       5 ← 4 ← 3 ← 2 ← 1 → None   (return prev = 5)
```

### ✅ Conclusion

Your code is correct, efficient, and well-written. It uses the classic **iterative reversal technique** with three pointers, making it ideal for interviews and production use.

> ✅ **Final Answer**: Output is `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` – the list has been successfully reversed!

Let’s go through this **step-by-step**, tracking `prev`, `curr`, and `nxt`.

---

## 🔍 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

### Initial State:
```
prev = None
curr = 1 (head)
nxt = not yet assigned
```

List looks like:
```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 1:
- `nxt = curr.next` → `nxt = 2`
- `curr.next = prev` → `1.next = None`  
  Now: `1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 1`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 2`

Now:
```
prev = 1 → None
curr = 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 2:
- `nxt = curr.next` → `nxt = 3`
- `curr.next = prev` → `2.next = 1`  
  Now: `2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 2`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 3`

Now:
```
prev = 2 → 1 → None
curr = 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 3:
- `nxt = 3.next` → `nxt = 4`
- `curr.next = prev` → `3.next = 2`  
  Now: `3 → 2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 3`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 4`

Now:
```
prev = 3 → 2 → 1 → None
curr = 4 → 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 4:
- `nxt = 4.next` → `nxt = 5`
- `curr.next = prev` → `4.next = 3`  
  Now: `4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 4`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = 5`

Now:
```
prev = 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None
curr = 5 → None
```

---

### 🟢 Iteration 5:
- `nxt = 5.next` → `nxt = None`
- `curr.next = prev` → `5.next = 4`  
  Now: `5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None`
- `prev = curr` → `prev = 5`
- `curr = nxt` → `curr = None`

Now loop ends because `curr` is `None`.

---

### ✅ Final Result:
Return `prev`, which is now pointing to **node 5** — the new head!

```
5 → 4 → 3 → 2 → 1 → None
```

✅ Success! The list is reversed.

---

### 📤 Output Section (in main block):

```python
new_head = reverseList(head)

result = []
while new_head:
    result.append(new_head.val)
    new_head = new_head.next
print("Output:", result)  # Output: [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
```

- We traverse the reversed list starting from `new_head = 5`.
- Append values: `5`, `4`, `3`, `2`, `1`.
- Print: `[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`

### 4. [Middle of the Linked List](https://leetcode.com/problems/middle-of-the-linked-list/)

#### 📌 Summary
Find the middle node of a linked list. If even length, return the second middle.

#### 🔗 Pattern(s)
- Fast/Slow Pointers

#### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def middleNode(head):
    # Both pointers start at head
    slow = head
    fast = head
    
    # Fast moves twice as fast
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    
    # When fast reaches end, slow is at middle
    return slow


# ---- Official LeetCode Example ----
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
    head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))))
    
    # Find middle
    mid = middleNode(head)
    print("Middle Value:", mid.val)  # Output: 3

    # Example Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
    head2 = ListNode(
    1,
    ListNode(
        2,
        ListNode(
            3,
            ListNode(
                4,
                ListNode(
                    5,
                    ListNode(6))))))
    mid2 = middleNode(head2)
    print("Middle Value:", mid2.val)  # Output: 4
```

Let's walk through the **example code** for finding the **middle node of a linked list** using the **"fast and slow pointer" technique**.

---

### 🧠 **Problem Summary**
Given a **non-empty** singly linked list, return the **middle node**.

- If there are **even number of nodes**, return the **second middle** node.
- Example:
  - `[1,2,3,4,5]` → middle is `3`
  - `[1,2,3,4,5,6]` → middle is `4`

---

## ✅ **Algorithm: Fast & Slow Pointers**

We use two pointers:
- `slow`: moves one step at a time.
- `fast`: moves two steps at a time.

When `fast` reaches the end (or beyond), `slow` will be at the **middle**.

---

### 🔍 Step-by-Step Walkthrough

#### 🔹 Example 1: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]` (Odd length)

```python
head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))))
```

Visual representation:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
↑         ↑
slow      fast
```

Now run the loop:

| Step | `slow` | `fast` | Action |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0    | 1      | 1      | Start |
| 1    | 2      | 3      | `slow.next`, `fast.next.next` |
| 2    | 3      | 5      | `slow.next`, `fast.next.next` |
| 3    | 4      | None   | `fast.next` is `None` → exit loop |

> Loop condition: `while fast and fast.next`  
> At this point, `fast.next` is `None`, so loop stops.

✅ `slow` is now at **node with value 3** → correct middle!

> Output: `Middle Value: 3`

---

#### 🔹 Example 2: `head = [1,2,3,4,5,6]` (Even length)

```python
head2 = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5, ListNode(6))))))
```

Visual:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6
↑         ↑
slow      fast
```

Loop iterations:

| Step | `slow` | `fast` | Action |
|------|--------|--------|--------|
| 0    | 1      | 1      | Start |
| 1    | 2      | 3      | Move both |
| 2    | 3      | 5      | Move both |
| 3    | 4      | None   | `fast.next` is `None` → stop |

Now `slow` is at **node with value 4**

> Why not 3? Because we want the **second middle** when even length — this is standard in LeetCode.

✅ Output: `Middle Value: 4`

---

### 📌 Key Insight

- When `fast` reaches the end (`fast == None` or `fast.next == None`), `slow` is exactly at the middle.
- For odd-length lists: one middle node.
- For even-length lists: `slow` points to the **second** of the two middle nodes (due to `fast` moving faster).

This works because:
- In each iteration, `fast` moves twice as far as `slow`.
- So by the time `fast` finishes, `slow` has gone half the distance → middle.

---

### ⚙️ Code Logic Breakdown

```python
def middleNode(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head

    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next          # +1 step
        fast = fast.next.next     # +2 steps

    return slow
```

- `fast and fast.next`: ensures that `fast.next` exists before accessing it. Prevents `AttributeError`.
- The loop continues until `fast` can't take another full jump (i.e., `fast.next` is `None`).
- At that moment, `slow` is at the middle.

---

### ✅ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**: O(n) — we traverse the list once.
- **Space**: O(1) — only two pointers used.

---

### 🎯 Why This Is Elegant

No need to count total nodes or store values. It’s efficient, clean, and uses minimal memory.

---

### 🏁 Final Notes

This solution is **the standard optimal approach** for finding the middle of a linked list on LeetCode and other coding platforms.

> ✔️ Works for both odd and even lengths  
> ✔️ One pass, constant space  
> ✔️ Clean and intuitive once you understand the "two-pointer" trick

### 5. [LRU Cache](https://leetcode.com/problems/lru-cache/)

#### 📌 Summary
Implement an LRU cache with `get(key)` and `put(key, value)` in O(1).

#### 🔗 Pattern(s)
- Hash Map + Doubly Linked List

#### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments

```python
class DListNode:
    def __init__(self, key=0, val=0):
        self.key = key
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None

class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}  # maps key -> DListNode
        self.head = DListNode()  # dummy head
        self.tail = DListNode()  # dummy tail
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head
    
    def _add_node(self, node):
        """Insert node right after head (most recent)"""
        node.prev = self.head
        node.next = self.head.next
        self.head.next.prev = node
        self.head.next = node
    
    def _remove_node(self, node):
        """Remove node from list"""
        node.prev.next = node.next
        node.next.prev = node.prev
    
    def _move_to_head(self, node):
        """Move existing node to head (most recent)"""
        self._remove_node(node)
        self._add_node(node)
    
    def _pop_tail(self):
        """Remove and return tail node (least recent)"""
        node = self.tail.prev
        self._remove_node(node)
        return node
    
    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        if key not in self.cache:
            return -1
        node = self.cache[key]
        self._move_to_head(node)
        return node.val
    
    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        if key in self.cache:
            # Update existing node
            node = self.cache[key]
            node.val = value
            self._move_to_head(node)
        else:
            # New node
            node = DListNode(key, value)
            self.cache[key] = node
            self._add_node(node)
            
            # If over capacity, remove least recent
            if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
                removed = self._pop_tail()
                del self.cache[removed.key]


# ---- Official LeetCode Example ----
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize cache with capacity 2
    lru = LRUCache(2)
    
    # Operations
    lru.put(1, 1)
    lru.put(2, 2)
    print("Get 1:", lru.get(1))  # Output: 1
    lru.put(3, 3)  # Removes key 2
    print("Get 2:", lru.get(2))  # Output: -1
    lru.put(4, 4)  # Removes key 1
    print("Get 1:", lru.get(1))  # Output: -1
    print("Get 3:", lru.get(3))  # Output: 3
    print("Get 4:", lru.get(4))  # Output: 4
```

---

### 🔍 **Problem Overview: LRU Cache**
- **LRU (Least Recently Used)**: When cache is full, remove the *least recently used* item.
- Supports:
  - `get(key)` → returns value if key exists, else `-1`
  - `put(key, value)` → inserts or updates key-value pair
- Must maintain order of usage (most recent at front, least recent at end)

We use a **doubly linked list** + **hash map (dictionary)** for O(1) operations.

---

## ✅ Data Structures Used

```python
class DListNode:
    def __init__(self, key=0, val=0):
        self.key = key
        self.val = val
        self.prev = None
        self.next = None
```

> Each node stores `key`, `value`, and pointers to previous/next nodes.

```python
class LRUCache:
    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.cache = {}  # maps key -> DListNode
        self.head = DListNode()  # dummy head
        self.tail = DListNode()  # dummy tail
        self.head.next = self.tail
        self.tail.prev = self.head
```

> - `cache`: fast lookup via key → node
> - `head` and `tail`: dummy nodes to simplify insertion/removal
> - List structure: `head ↔ node1 ↔ node2 ↔ ... ↔ tail`

---

## 🛠️ Key Helper Methods

### 1. `_add_node(node)`
Inserts a new node **right after head** (i.e., most recently used).

```python
def _add_node(self, node):
    node.prev = self.head
    node.next = self.head.next
    self.head.next.prev = node
    self.head.next = node
```

> Example:  
> Before: `head → A → B → tail`  
> After adding `X`: `head → X → A → B → tail`

✅ Places the node at the front (most recent)

---

### 2. `_remove_node(node)`
Removes a node from the list.

```python
def _remove_node(self, node):
    node.prev.next = node.next
    node.next.prev = node.prev
```

> Breaks the links around `node`. Useful when moving or deleting.

---

### 3. `_move_to_head(node)`
Moves an existing node to the front (most recent).

```python
def _move_to_head(self, node):
    self._remove_node(node)
    self._add_node(node)
```

> Reuse helper functions to efficiently update position.

---

### 4. `_pop_tail()`
Removes the **least recently used** node (just before `tail`).

```python
def _pop_tail(self):
    node = self.tail.prev
    self._remove_node(node)
    return node
```

> Returns the node so we can delete it from `cache`.

---

## 📌 Core Operations

### `get(key)`
```python
def get(self, key: int) -> int:
    if key not in self.cache:
        return -1
    node = self.cache[key]
    self._move_to_head(node)
    return node.val
```

> - If not found → return `-1`
> - If found → move to front (mark as recently used), return value

---

### `put(key, value)`
```python
def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
    if key in self.cache:
        # Update existing node
        node = self.cache[key]
        node.val = value
        self._move_to_head(node)
    else:
        # New node
        node = DListNode(key, value)
        self.cache[key] = node
        self._add_node(node)
        
        # If over capacity, remove least recent
        if len(self.cache) > self.capacity:
            removed = self._pop_tail()
            del self.cache[removed.key]
```

> - If key exists: update value, move to front
> - Else: create new node, add to front
> - If size exceeds capacity: remove tail (least recent), delete from `cache`

---

## 🧪 Example Walkthrough

```python
lru = LRUCache(2)
```

Initial state:
```
head ↔ tail
cache = {}
```

---

### Step 1: `lru.put(1, 1)`
- New key `1`, value `1`
- Create node: `DListNode(1, 1)`
- Add to front: `head → [1] → tail`
- `cache = {1: node_1}`

List: `head ↔ 1 ↔ tail`  
Cache: `{1: node_1}`

---

### Step 2: `lru.put(2, 2)`
- New key `2`, value `2`
- Create node: `DListNode(2, 2)`
- Add to front: `head → [2] → [1] → tail`
- `cache = {1: node_1, 2: node_2}`

List: `head ↔ 2 ↔ 1 ↔ tail`  
Cache: `{1: node_1, 2: node_2}`

---

### Step 3: `print("Get 1:", lru.get(1))`
- Key `1` exists → get node
- Move `1` to front: remove `1`, insert after `head`
- Now: `head ↔ 1 ↔ 2 ↔ tail`
- Return `1`

✅ Output: `1`

---

### Step 4: `lru.put(3, 3)`
- Key `3` not in cache → new entry
- Create `DListNode(3, 3)`
- Add to front: `head → 3 → 1 → 2 → tail`
- Now cache has 3 entries → over capacity (max 2)
- Remove **least recent**: tail’s prev = `2`
- Remove `2` from list and cache

Final state:
- List: `head ↔ 3 ↔ 1 ↔ tail`
- Cache: `{3: node_3, 1: node_1}`

> `2` is evicted!

✅ Output: `Get 2:` → `-1` (because `2` was removed)

---

### Step 5: `lru.put(4, 4)`
- Key `4` not in cache → new entry
- Add `4` to front: `head → 4 → 3 → 1 → tail`
- Size now 3 → must remove least recent (`1`)
- Remove `1` from list and cache

Final state:
- List: `head ↔ 4 ↔ 3 ↔ tail`
- Cache: `{4: node_4, 3: node_3}`

> `1` is gone!

---

### Final Queries:

```python
print("Get 1:", lru.get(1))  # -1 (not in cache)
print("Get 3:", lru.get(3))  # 3 (was recently accessed)
print("Get 4:", lru.get(4))  # 4
```

✅ Output:
```
Get 1: 1
Get 2: -1
Get 1: -1
Get 3: 3
Get 4: 4
```

Wait — there's a small discrepancy in expected output.

Let’s correct the **actual expected outputs** based on logic:

| Operation | Output |
|--------|-------|
| `get(1)` after `put(1,1)` and `put(2,2)` | `1` ✅ |
| `get(2)` after `put(3,3)` | `-1` ✅ (evicted) |
| `get(1)` after `put(4,4)` | `-1` ✅ (evicted) |
| `get(3)` | `3` ✅ |
| `get(4)` | `4` ✅ |

So final printout should be:

```
Get 1: 1
Get 2: -1
Get 1: -1
Get 3: 3
Get 4: 4
```

✅ Matches expected behavior.

## 📈 Summary: How It Works

| Feature | Implementation |
|-------|----------------|
| Fast lookup | Hashmap (`cache`) |
| Order tracking | Doubly linked list |
| Most recent | At front (`head.next`) |
| Least recent | Just before `tail` |
| Insertion | At front |
| Removal | From tail when full |
| Update | Move existing node to front |

---

## ⚡ Time Complexity
- `get()` → O(1)
- `put()` → O(1)
- All operations are constant time due to hash map + double linked list.

---

## ✅ Why This Design?
- **Hash map**: O(1) access to any node
- **Doubly linked list**: O(1) insertion/deletion anywhere
- Dummy nodes eliminate edge cases (e.g., empty list)

This is the **standard optimal solution** for LRU Cache on LeetCode.

---

## 💡 Pro Tips
- Always use **dummy head/tail** to avoid null checks
- Keep `cache` mapping key → node (so you don’t need to search the list)
- When updating a key, **move it to head** to mark as recently used
- When inserting a new key, **add to head**, then **evict tail** if needed

    # Move both until right reaches end
    while right:
        left = left.next
        right = right.next
    
    # Now left.next is the node to remove
    left.next = left.next.next
    
    # Return new head
    return dummy.next


# ---- Official LeetCode Example ----
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Example Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
    head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))))
    
    # Remove 2nd from end → remove 4
    new_head = removeNthFromEnd(head, 2)
    
    # Output: [1,2,3,5]
    result = []
    while new_head:
        result.append(new_head.val)
        new_head = new_head.next
    print("Output:", result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

## ✅ **Key Idea: Two Pointers (Fast & Slow)**

We use two pointers:
- `left` starts at a dummy node.
- `right` starts at the head.

We move `right` ahead by `n` steps first. Then we move both pointers together until `right` reaches the end (`None`). At that point, `left` will be just before the node to delete.

This way, we can easily bypass the target node using `left.next = left.next.next`.

---

## 🧠 Why Use a Dummy Node?

To handle edge cases like removing the **head** of the list.

Without a dummy:
- If you try to remove the first node (i.e., when `n == length`), there's no "previous" node to update.

With a dummy:
- The dummy acts as a fake head.
- You always have a valid `left` pointer pointing to the node before the one to remove.
- Even if you're removing the actual head, `dummy.next` will correctly point to the new head.

---

## 📌 Step-by-Step Execution with Example

### Input:
```python
head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
```

So the linked list looks like:
```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

### Step 1: Create Dummy Node
```python
dummy = ListNode(0)
dummy.next = head  # dummy → 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → None
```

Now:
- `left = dummy` (at 0)
- `right = head` (at 1)

### Step 2: Move `right` ahead by `n = 2` steps

Loop: `for _ in range(2)`
- After 1st iteration: `right = 2`
- After 2nd iteration: `right = 3`

Now:
- `left = dummy` (still at 0)
- `right = 3` (node with value 3)

### Step 3: Move both pointers until `right` hits `None`

While `right` is not `None`:
- Move both `left` and `right` one step forward.

#### Iteration 1:
- `left = 1`, `right = 4`

#### Iteration 2:
- `left = 2`, `right = 5`

#### Iteration 3:
- `left = 3`, `right = None` → loop ends

Now:
- `left` is at node `3`
- `right` is `None`

> So `left.next` is the node to remove — which is `4`.

### Step 4: Remove the Node

```python
left.next = left.next.next
```

That means:
```python
# left.next was 4 → 5
# left.next.next is 5
# So now: left.next becomes 5
```

So the list becomes:
```
dummy → 1 → 2 → 3 → 5 → None
```

### Step 5: Return `dummy.next`

Return `dummy.next`, which is `1`.

So final result: `[1, 2, 3, 5]`

---

## ✅ Final Output

```python
print("Output:", result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

✔️ Correct!

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

| Metric | Complexity |
|-------|------------|
| Time  | O(L), where L is the length of the list (we traverse once) |
| Space | O(1), only using constant extra space |

Very efficient!

---

## 🎯 Edge Case Check: Removing Head

Try `n = 5` (remove 5th from end → first node):

- `right` moves 5 steps: goes from 1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → `None`
- Now `right` is `None`, so the while loop doesn't run.
- `left` still points to `dummy`
- Then: `left.next = left.next.next` → removes `1`
- Return `dummy.next` → which is `2`

✅ Works perfectly!

---

## ✅ Summary

- **Algorithm**: Two-pointer technique with a dummy node.
- **Why it works**: Gap of `n` between `left` and `right` ensures `left` stops just before the target node.
- **Strengths**: Single pass, handles all edge cases cleanly.
- **Use Case**: Ideal for "remove Nth from end" problems.

---

## 💡 Pro Tip

You can generalize this idea to other similar problems:
- Find the middle of a linked list (fast/slow pointers).
- Detect cycles (Floyd’s algorithm).
- Check if a linked list is a palindrome (reverse half + compare).

```

#### 🔍 Walkthrough (Example)
Let's walk through the provided `reorderList` function step-by-step with a detailed explanation, using the example input `[1,2,3,4]`.

---

### 🔍 **Goal**
Reorder a linked list such that:
- The first node stays at the front,
- Then the last node,
- Then the second node,
- Then the second-to-last node,
- And so on.

For input: `[1,2,3,4]` → Output: `[1,4,2,3]`

This is known as **reordering a linked list in zigzag (interleaved) order**.

---

## ✅ Step 1: Define the ListNode Class

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```

Simple singly linked list node definition.

---

## 🧩 Step 2: Input Setup

```python
head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4))))
```

Creates the linked list:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

---

## 🔎 Step 3: `reorderList(head)` Function

### 🟢 Part A: Base Case

```python
if not head or not head.next:
    return
```

If there's only one node or none, no reordering needed. We skip.

✅ Our list has 4 nodes → continue.

---

### 🟡 Part B: Find the Middle Using Slow & Fast Pointers

```python
slow = fast = head
while fast and fast.next:
    slow = slow.next
    fast = fast.next.next
```

Let’s trace this:

| Iteration | `fast`       | `slow`       |
|----------|--------------|--------------|
| Start    | `1`          | `1`          |
| 1st      | `3` (next of 2) | `2` (next of 1) |
| 2nd      | `4` (next of 3) | `3` (next of 2) |
| 3rd      | `None`       | `4` (next of 3) |

Wait! Let's correct:

Actually:

- Initially: `fast = 1`, `slow = 1`
- First loop:  
  - `fast = fast.next.next = 3` → `fast.next = 4`, so `fast = 3`  
  - `slow = slow.next = 2`
- Second loop:  
  - `fast = fast.next.next = 4.next = None` → `fast = 4.next = None` → stops loop
  - So `fast` becomes `None`, exit loop.

So after loop:
- `slow` is at **node 3**
- `fast` is `None`

👉 So middle is **node 3**, which splits the list into:
- First half: `1 -> 2`
- Second half: `3 -> 4`

> Note: Since length is even (4), we want to split after 2nd node. This method gives us the **start of second half** at node 3 — correct.

---

### 🔴 Part C: Reverse the Second Half

We reverse the part starting from `slow` (node 3):

```python
prev = None
curr = slow  # curr starts at node 3
```

Now reverse the second half (`3 -> 4`) → becomes `4 -> 3`

Trace:

| Step | `curr` | `nxt` | `curr.next = prev` | `prev = curr` | `curr = nxt` |
|------|--------|-------|--------------------|---------------|--------------|
| 1    | 3      | 4     | 3.next = None     | prev = 3      | curr = 4     |
| 2    | 4      | None  | 4.next = 3        | prev = 4      | curr = None  |

After this loop:
- `prev = 4` → new head of reversed second half
- The list now looks like:
  - First half: `1 -> 2`
  - Reversed second half: `4 -> 3` (but still connected via original links)

But note: the original link `3->4` is broken during reversal.

So now:
- `head = 1 -> 2`
- `prev = 4 -> 3`

---

### 🟣 Part D: Merge First Half and Reversed Second Half

```python
first = head      # first = 1
second = prev     # second = 4
```

Now merge by interleaving:

```python
while second.next:
    tmp1 = first.next   # save first.next (which is 2)
    tmp2 = second.next  # save second.next (which is 3)

    # Interleave
    first.next = second        # 1 -> 4
    second.next = tmp1         # 4 -> 2

    # Move forward
    first = tmp1               # first = 2
    second = tmp2              # second = 3
```

Let’s go step by step:

#### 🔹 First iteration:
- `tmp1 = first.next = 2`
- `tmp2 = second.next = 3`
- Set:
  - `first.next = second` → `1.next = 4` → `1 -> 4`
  - `second.next = tmp1` → `4.next = 2` → `4 -> 2`
- Now:
  - `first = 2`
  - `second = 3`

Current state:
```
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
```

And `3.next` is still `None`? Wait – what about `3`?

Originally, after reversal, `4 -> 3`, then `3.next` was set to `None` during reversal. But here we didn't change it.

Yes: `3.next` is `None`. So `second.next` is `None`.

So `while second.next:` → condition fails!

So we break out of the loop **after just one iteration**.

---

### ❗ Problem Detected!

The loop condition is:

```python
while second.next:
```

That means we stop when `second.next` is `None`.

But in our case:
- After first iteration, `second = 3`, and `3.next = None` → loop ends.
- So we never connect `2` to `3`.

Wait — but currently:
- `1 -> 4 -> 2`
- `2` points to `3`? No — `2.next` was saved as `tmp1`, but we did not update `2.next`.

Hold on — let’s reconstruct the actual structure after the first iteration:

Before:
```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4
```

After reversing second half:
```
1 -> 2
4 -> 3 (and 3.next = None)
```

Then:
- `first = 1`, `second = 4`
- `tmp1 = 2`, `tmp2 = 3`
- `first.next = second` → `1.next = 4`
- `second.next = tmp1` → `4.next = 2`
- Then `first = 2`, `second = 3`

Now the chain is:
```
1 -> 4 -> 2
     ↑
     3 (but 3 is not connected to anything)
```

And `2.next` is still pointing to `3` originally? No — wait!

When we did `tmp1 = first.next`, we saved `2` as `tmp1`, but `2.next` is still `3`.

So after:
- `4.next = 2`
- `2.next` is still `3` → so `2 -> 3`

So now full list is:
```
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
```

✅ That’s exactly what we want!

But why did the loop stop? Because `second = 3`, and `3.next = None`, so `second.next` is `None`, so `while second.next:` fails.

But that’s okay! We don’t need more iterations because:
- We’ve already merged the two parts.
- The remaining nodes are already connected correctly.

Wait — is `2 -> 3` valid?

Yes! After merging:
- `1 -> 4` ✅
- `4 -> 2` ✅
- `2 -> 3` ✅ (original connection, untouched)

So final result: `1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3` → perfect.

---

### ⚠️ But Why Does Loop Stop Early?

Because the loop condition is:

```python
while second.next:
```

It checks if `second.next` exists. When `second = 3`, its `next` is `None`, so loop exits.

But we don’t need to do another merge step because:
- Only one pair left: `2` and `3`
- We already have `4 -> 2`, and `2 -> 3` is intact
- So `3` is naturally placed at end

So the logic works **only because the number of nodes is even**.

What if it were odd?

Let’s say `[1,2,3,4,5]` → middle is `3`, second half is `3,4,5` → reverse to `5,4,3`

Merge:
- `1 -> 5 -> 2 -> 4 -> 3` → correct

In that case, you'd need to keep going until `second.next` is null.

But in our code, the loop stops too early?

Let’s test that idea briefly.

No — actually, for odd-length lists, the second half has an odd number of nodes, so the `while second.next:` condition will still work correctly.

But in **our current implementation**, we’re relying on `second.next` being non-null to continue.

However, consider this:

After merging:
- `first` moves to `2`
- `second` moves to `3`
- Now `second.next` is `None` → loop ends

But we haven’t yet connected `2` to `3`?

Wait — no, `2.next` was saved as `tmp1`, and we used it in `second.next = tmp1`, i.e., `4.next = 2`, but `2.next` itself remains unchanged.

So `2.next` still points to `3`, so `2 -> 3` is preserved.

Thus, **the final chain is formed naturally**.

So the algorithm is correct.

---

## ✅ Final Result

After `reorderList(head)`:

Chain becomes:
```
1 -> 4 -> 2 -> 3
```

Output: `[1, 4, 2, 3]`

✔️ Matches expected.

---

## 📌 Summary of Algorithm Steps

1. **Find middle** using slow/fast pointers → split list into two halves.
2. **Reverse the second half** → so we can interleave easily.
3. **Interleave first half and reversed second half**:
   - Use two pointers: `first` (from start), `second` (from reversed end).
   - At each step:
     - Save `first.next` and `second.next`.
     - Link `first.next = second`.
     - Link `second.next = first.next_old`.
     - Advance both pointers.
4. Loop continues while `second.next` exists → ensures we don’t try to merge beyond the end.

> Note: The loop condition could be improved to `while second` (i.e., while second is not None), but since we're always linking `second.next` to something, and the last node doesn't need to be "merged" further, it's safe.

However, **a better condition** would be:

```python
while first and second:
```

But in our case, since we're advancing both, and the lengths are balanced, it works.

But in current code, the condition `while second.next` might fail prematurely if `second` is the last node.

Wait — in our example, `second = 3`, `second.next = None`, so loop ends.

But `3` is supposed to be the last node — so we’re fine.

But suppose we had `first = 2`, `second = 3`, and `3.next = None` → loop ends → done.

But `2 -> 3` is already there → correct.

So yes, it's correct.

---

## ✅ Final Answer: Output

```python
print("Output:", result)  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 3]
```

✅ Correct.

---

## 🔄 Bonus: Edge Cases

| Input | Expected Output |
|------|------------------|
| `[1]` | `[1]` |
| `[1,2]` | `[1,2]` |
| `[1,2,3]` | `[1,3,2]` |
| `[1,2,3,4,5]` | `[1,5,2,4,3]` |

All handled correctly by this algorithm.

---

## ✅ Conclusion

Your code is **correct and efficient**:
- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

It uses:
- Two-pointer technique to find middle
- In-place reversal
- Interleaving via pointer manipulation

Only minor issue: loop condition `while second.next` might be slightly brittle.

### 🔧 Suggested Fix (More Robust)

Replace:

```python
while second.next:
```

With:

```python
while first and second:
```

Or even better:

```python
while first.next and second.next:
```

But in your current version, it works due to natural chaining.

Alternatively, use:

```python
while first and second:
    tmp1 = first.next
    tmp2 = second.next
    
    first.next = second
    second.next = tmp1
    
    first = tmp1
    second = tmp2
```

This avoids relying on `second.next` and handles edge cases better.

But for even-length lists like `[1,2,3,4]`, your current version works perfectly.

---

### ✅ Final Verdict

Your code is **correct and well-written**. The walkthrough confirms it produces the expected output `[1,4,2,3]` for the given example.

### 13. [Rotate List](https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-list/)

#### ✅ **Problem Summary**
Given a linked list and an integer `k`, rotate the list **to the right** by `k` steps.

> Example:  
> Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, `k = 2`  
> Output: `4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`

Rotating right means the last `k` nodes are moved to the front in the same order.

## 🔧 Code Breakdown

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next
```
- Simple definition of a singly linked list node.

---

### 🔄 Function: `rotateRight(head, k)`

#### Step 1: Handle edge cases
```python
if not head or not head.next:
    return head
```
- If the list is empty or has only one node, rotating doesn't change anything.
- Return the original head.

✅ **Example**: `head = [1]` → still `[1]` after rotation.

---

#### Step 2: Find the length and tail of the list
```python
length = 1
tail = head
while tail.next:
    tail = tail.next
    length += 1
```
- Traverse the list from head to end (`tail`) while counting nodes.
- After this loop:
  - `length` = total number of nodes
  - `tail` = last node of the list

✅ For input `[1,2,3,4,5]`:  
→ `length = 5`, `tail` points to node `5`.

---

#### Step 3: Normalize `k`
```python
k %= length
if k == 0:
    return head
```
- Since rotating by `length` steps brings us back to the same list, we reduce `k` using modulo.
- If `k == 0`, no effective rotation → return original head.

✅ Example: `k = 7`, `length = 5` → `k %= 5` → `k = 2`. So rotate by 2.

---

#### Step 4: Find the **new tail**
```python
new_tail = head
for _ in range(length - k - 1):
    new_tail = new_tail.next
```
- We want to break the list just before the **new head**.
- The new head will be at position `(length - k)` from the start.
- So we move `length - k - 1` steps from the head to reach the **new tail**.

✅ Example: `length = 5`, `k = 2` → need to stop at index `5 - 2 - 1 = 2`  
So we go from head:
- Step 0: `new_tail` → node 1
- Step 1: `new_tail` → node 2
- Step 2: `new_tail` → node 3 ← this is our new tail!

Thus, the new head will be `node 4`.

---

#### Step 5: Define new head and reconnect
```python
new_head = new_tail.next
```
- New head is the node after the new tail → `node 4`

```python
new_tail.next = None
```
- Break the link: now the list ends at `node 3`.

```python
tail.next = head
```
- Connect the old tail (`node 5`) to the old head (`node 1`).  
This makes the list circular temporarily.

Now the chain looks like:
```
[1->2->3]   [4->5] -> 1 (circular)
```

But since we broke the first part at `3`, the full structure becomes:
```
4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

✅ Final result: `[4,5,1,2,3]` — correct!

---

#### Step 6: Return new head
```python
return new_head
```

## 📌 Full Example Walkthrough

### Input:
```python
head = ListNode(1, ListNode(2, ListNode(3, ListNode(4, ListNode(5)))))
k = 2
```

List: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`

Steps:

| Step | Action |
|------|--------|
| 1 | `length = 5`, `tail = node 5` |
| 2 | `k %= 5` → `k = 2` |
| 3 | Move `5 - 2 - 1 = 2` steps: `new_tail = node 3` |
| 4 | `new_head = node 4` |
| 5 | Break: `node 3.next = None`<br>`node 5.next = node 1` |

Final list:
```
4 -> 5 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3
```

✅ Output: `[4,5,1,2,3]`

## ✅ Output Verification (in your main block)

```python
rotated = rotateRight(head, 2)
result = []
while rotated:
    result.append(rotated.val)
    rotated = rotated.next
print("Output:", result)  # [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```

✔️ Matches expected output.

---

## 🎯 Key Insights

- Rotating right by `k` is equivalent to cutting the list after the `(length - k)`th node.
- Reconnecting the last part to the front forms the rotated list.
- Modulo operation avoids unnecessary full cycles.
- Time complexity: **O(n)** – one pass to find length, one more to find new tail.
- Space complexity: **O(1)** – only pointers used.

---

## 💡 Bonus Tip: Visualize It!

Imagine a circular rope with nodes `1,2,3,4,5` connected in a loop.

To rotate right by 2:
- Cut the rope **after node 3**.
- Move the segment `4,5` to the front.

Result: `4,5,1,2,3`

That’s exactly what the algorithm does!

## ✅ Summary

| Part | Purpose |
|------|--------|
| `length` & `tail` | Determine size and end of list |
| `k %= length` | Avoid redundant rotations |
| `new_tail` | Find where to cut |
| `new_head = new_tail.next` | First node of rotated part |
| `new_tail.next = None` | Break list |
| `tail.next = head` | Link old end to old start |

### 14. [Reverse Nodes in k-Group](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-nodes-in-k-group/)

#### 📌 Summary
Reverse every k nodes in groups. If fewer than k remain, leave them unchanged.

#### 🔗 Pattern(s)
- Pointer Rewiring + Dummy Node + Reversing Sublist

Let's walk through the **`reverseKGroup`** problem step-by-step using your provided code and a real example from **LeetCode (Problem 25: Reverse Nodes in k-Group)**.

---

## 🔗 **Problem Recap**
> Given a linked list and an integer `k`, reverse the nodes of the list in groups of `k`. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k`, then left-out nodes should remain as they are.

### ✅ Example:
```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,5]
```

We reverse every group of 2 nodes:
- First group: `1 -> 2` becomes `2 -> 1`
- Second group: `3 -> 4` becomes `4 -> 3`
- Last node `5` remains because only one node is left (not enough for a full group of 2)

---

## 🧠 Code Walkthrough

Here’s your code with comments added for clarity:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseKGroup(head, k):
    # Dummy node to simplify edge cases
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    prev_group_end = dummy  # Points to end of last reversed group

    while True:
        # Step 1: Find the kth node from prev_group_end
        kth = prev_group_end
        for _ in range(k):
            kth = kth.next
            if not kth:  # Not enough nodes left → stop
                return dummy.next

        next_group_start = kth.next  # Save start of next group

        # Step 2: Reverse the k nodes between prev_group_end.next and kth
        current = prev_group_end.next  # Start of current group
        prev = None
        while current != next_group_start:
            temp = current.next
            current.next = prev
            prev = current
            current = temp

        # Step 3: Connect the reversed group back into the list
        old_head = prev_group_end.next  # This was the first node before reversal
        old_head.next = next_group_start  # Connect the tail of reversed group to next group
        prev_group_end.next = kth  # Make kth (new head) point to this group

        # Step 4: Move prev_group_end to the end of this reversed group
        prev_group_end = old_head  # Now old_head is the last node of the reversed group
```

---

## 📌 Step-by-Step Execution with Example: `1->2->3->4->5`, `k=2`

### Initial Setup:
```text
dummy -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
          ↑
      prev_group_end
```

---

### 🔁 Iteration 1: Reverse first group `[1,2]`

#### Step 1: Find kth node (`k=2`)
- Start at `prev_group_end` (dummy)
- Move 2 steps:
  - After 1st: points to `1`
  - After 2nd: points to `2` → this is `kth`
- `kth` exists → continue

→ `next_group_start = kth.next = 3`

#### Step 2: Reverse nodes from `1` to `2`

We reverse `1 -> 2` → becomes `2 -> 1`

```python
current = 1
prev = None

Iteration 1:
  temp = 2
  1.next = None
  prev = 1
  current = 2

Iteration 2:
  temp = 3
  2.next = 1
  prev = 2
  current = 3 → stops since current == next_group_start (3)
```

Now the segment looks like:
```text
dummy -> 1 -> 2 becomes: dummy -> 2 -> 1
                 ↑         ↑
               old_head   kth
```

#### Step 3: Reconnect the reversed group

- `old_head = prev_group_end.next = 1` (original first node)
- `old_head.next = next_group_start = 3` → so `1.next = 3`
- `prev_group_end.next = kth = 2` → so `dummy.next = 2`

Now list is:
```text
dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
                  ↑     ↑
              old_head  next_group_start
```

#### Step 4: Update `prev_group_end`
- Set `prev_group_end = old_head = 1` → now it points to the **end** of the reversed group

✅ Group `[1,2]` successfully reversed!

---

### 🔁 Iteration 2: Reverse second group `[3,4]`

#### Step 1: Find kth node (`k=2`)
- Start at `prev_group_end = 1`
- Move 2 steps:
  - 1 → 3
  - 3 → 4 → `kth = 4`
- `kth` exists → continue
- `next_group_start = 5`

#### Step 2: Reverse nodes from `3` to `4`

Reverse `3 -> 4` → becomes `4 -> 3`

```python
current = 3
prev = None

Iter 1:
  temp = 4
  3.next = None
  prev = 3
  current = 4

Iter 2:
  temp = 5
  4.next = 3
  prev = 4
  current = 5 → stop
```

Now we have:
```text
... -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
             ↑     ↑
           old_head  next_group_start
```

#### Step 3: Reconnect
- `old_head = prev_group_end.next = 3`
- `old_head.next = next_group_start = 5` → `3.next = 5`
- `prev_group_end.next = kth = 4` → `1.next = 4`

Now the list becomes:
```text
dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
                     ↑     ↑
                   old_head  next_group_start
```

#### Step 4: Update `prev_group_end`
- `prev_group_end = old_head = 3`

✅ Group `[3,4]` reversed!

---

### 🔁 Iteration 3: Try to reverse third group

#### Step 1: Find kth node
- Start at `prev_group_end = 3`
- Move 2 steps:
  - 3 → 5
  - 5 → `None` → `kth = None`

🛑 Condition: `if not kth: return dummy.next`

So we break out of the loop.

---

### ✅ Final Result:
```text
dummy -> 2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5
```

Return `dummy.next = 2`

➡️ Output: `2 -> 1 -> 4 -> 3 -> 5` ✅

---

## 🎯 Summary of Key Concepts

| Concept | Explanation |
|-------|------------|
| **Dummy Node** | Avoids handling edge cases when reversing the first group. |
| **prev_group_end** | Keeps track of where the previous group ended — helps reconnect. |
| **kth Node** | Used to check if there are at least `k` nodes remaining. |
| **Reversal Logic** | Standard iterative reversal of linked list (like in "Reverse Linked List" problem). |
| **Connect Back** | After reversal, link: `old_head.next = next_group_start`, and `prev_group_end.next = kth`. |

## ✅ LeetCode Official Example Verification

> **Input**: `head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2`  
> **Expected Output**: `[2,1,4,3,5]`  
> ✔️ Matches our result!

Another test case:
```text
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 3
Output: [3,2,1,4,5]
```
- First group: `1->2->3` → reversed to `3->2->1`
- Remaining: `4->5` → less than 3 nodes → leave unchanged
- So output: `3->2->1->4->5` ✅

---

## ⏱️ Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes — each node visited at most twice.
- **Space**: O(1) — only using constant extra pointers.

---

## ✅ Final Notes

Your code is **correct**, well-structured, and handles all edge cases (like incomplete groups). The logic is solid and follows standard LeetCode patterns.

💡 **Tip**: Always use a dummy node when modifying the head of a linked list — it makes life easier!
