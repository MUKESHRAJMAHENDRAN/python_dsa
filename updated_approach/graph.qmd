## 🔷 Chunk 1: Graph Traversal & BFS/DFS Patterns

### 🧩 Pattern: **DFS / BFS on Grid (2D Array)**
> *Used for connected components, flood fill, shortest path in unweighted grids.*

#### ✅ How to Recognize:
- Problem involves a 2D grid (`matrix`, `grid`, `board`) with cells that can be visited or blocked.
- You're asked to:
  - Count islands
  - Find shortest path
  - Flood-fill a region
  - Traverse all reachable cells from a starting point
- Movement is typically up/down/left/right (sometimes diagonals)

#### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (The Recipe):
1. **Check bounds**: Ensure row/col indices are within grid dimensions.
2. **Check visited state**: Use a `visited` set or mark grid in-place (e.g., change value).
3. **Base case**: If cell is invalid, out of bounds, or already visited → return.
4. **Process current cell**: Do work (e.g., increment count, update distance).
5. **Recursive/Queue-based traversal**: Call DFS/BFS on neighbors.
6. **Return result**: Based on problem (count, path length, etc.).

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases:
- Forgetting to mark visited nodes → infinite loop.
- Not handling edge cases like empty grid, single cell, or no valid path.
- Using recursion for large grids → stack overflow (use iterative BFS instead).
- Misinterpreting movement rules (e.g., only 4-directional vs 8-directional).

## 📌 Problem 1: [Flood Fill](https://leetcode.com/problems/flood-fill/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given a 2D image represented as a matrix of integers, start at a pixel `(sr, sc)` and replace all adjacent pixels with the same color as the starting pixel with a new color. Adjacency is defined as 4-directional.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **DFS / BFS on Grid**
- **Connected Components**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
def floodFill(image, sr, sc, newColor):
    # Get dimensions of the image
    rows, cols = len(image), len(image[0])
    
    # Original color at the starting pixel
    original_color = image[sr][sc]
    
    # If the new color is same as old, no need to do anything
    if original_color == newColor:
        return image
    
    # Use DFS to fill the region
    def dfs(r, c):
        # Base case: check bounds and if pixel has correct original color
        if (r < 0 or r >= rows or 
            c < 0 or c >= cols or 
            image[r][c] != original_color):
            return
        
        # Change the color of current pixel
        image[r][c] = newColor
        
        # Recursively apply DFS to 4 neighbors
        dfs(r + 1, c)  # down
        dfs(r - 1, c)  # up
        dfs(r, c + 1)  # right
        dfs(r, c - 1)  # left
    
    # Start DFS from the initial pixel
    dfs(sr, sc)
    
    return image
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
`image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]]`, `sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2`

**Step-by-step:**
1. Start at `(1,1)` — original color = `1`, new color = `2`.
2. Mark `(1,1)` → `2`.
3. Visit neighbors:
   - `(2,1)` → color `0` ≠ `1` → skip
   - `(0,1)` → color `1` → mark as `2`
     - From `(0,1)`: visit `(0,0)` → `1` → mark as `2`
       - From `(0,0)`: neighbors `(0,1)` already done; `(1,0)` → `1` → mark as `2`
         - From `(1,0)`: neighbors `(2,0)` → `1` → mark as `2`
           - From `(2,0)`: neighbor `(2,1)` → `0` → skip
   - `(1,2)` → `0` → skip
   - `(1,0)` → already processed via chain

**Final Image:**
```
[[2,2,2],
 [2,2,0],
 [2,0,1]]
```

✅ Output matches expected.

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(m×n) — each cell visited once
- **Space:** O(m×n) — worst-case recursion depth (stack) if entire grid is filled

## 📌 Problem 2: [01 Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given a binary matrix, find the distance from each cell to the nearest `0`. Distance is Manhattan distance.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **Multi-source BFS**
- **Shortest Path in Unweighted Grid**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
from collections import deque

def updateMatrix(mat):
    rows, cols = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    
    # Initialize result matrix with infinity (or large number)
    dist = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Queue for BFS: store (row, col, distance)
    queue = deque()
    
    # Add all '0' cells as sources with distance 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if mat[i][j] == 0:
                dist[i][j] = 0
                queue.append((i, j))
    
    # Directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Multi-source BFS
    while queue:
        r, c = queue.popleft()
        current_dist = dist[r][c]
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            
            # Check bounds and if we can update distance
            if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and 
                dist[nr][nc] > current_dist + 1):
                
                # Update distance and add to queue
                dist[nr][nc] = current_dist + 1
                queue.append((nr, nc))
    
    return dist
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
`mat = [[0,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]`

**Step-by-step:**
1. All `0`s go into queue with distance `0`.
2. Process `(0,0)`, `(0,1)`, `(0,2)`, `(1,0)`, `(1,2)` → update their neighbors:
   - From `(0,0)`: `(1,0)` already in queue → skip
   - From `(0,1)`: `(1,1)` → set to `1`, add to queue
   - From `(1,0)`: `(2,0)` → set to `1`, add to queue
   - From `(1,2)`: `(2,2)` → set to `1`, add to queue
3. Now process `(1,1)` → update `(2,1)` → set to `2`
4. Process `(2,0)` → `(2,1)` already updated
5. Process `(2,2)` → `(2,1)` already updated
6. Final distances:
```
[[0,0,0],
 [0,1,0],
 [1,2,1]]
```

✅ Matches expected output.

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(m×n) — each cell processed at most once
- **Space:** O(m×n) — for `dist` array and queue (max size ~m×n)

## 📌 Problem 3: [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given a 2D grid of `'1'`s (land) and `'0'`s (water), count the number of distinct islands (connected groups of `'1'`s).

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **DFS/BFS on Grid**
- **Connected Components**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
def numIslands(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    islands = 0
    
    # Directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    
    def dfs(r, c):
        # Base case: out of bounds or water or already visited
        if (r < 0 or r >= rows or 
            c < 0 or c >= cols or 
            grid[r][c] == '0' or 
            visited[r][c]):
            return
        
        # Mark as visited
        visited[r][c] = True
        
        # Explore all 4 neighbors
        for dr, dc in directions:
            dfs(r + dr, c + dc)
    
    # Iterate through every cell
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # If land not visited, start DFS → new island
            if grid[i][j] == '1' and not visited[i][j]:
                dfs(i, j)
                islands += 1
    
    return islands
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
```
[
  ["1","1","1","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","1","0"],
  ["1","1","0","0","0"],
  ["0","0","0","0","0"]
]
```

**Step-by-step:**
- Start at `(0,0)` → land → DFS covers entire top-left island → count = 1
- Move to `(0,4)` → water → skip
- Continue until `(1,1)` → already visited
- At `(1,3)` → land → but not visited? Wait: `(1,3)` is part of first island?
  - Actually, `(1,3)` connects to `(0,3)` → which connects to `(0,0)` → so it’s one island!
- Only one connected component exists.

Wait! But input shows two separate islands?

Let me recheck:

```
Row 0: 1 1 1 1 0
Row 1: 1 1 0 1 0
Row 2: 1 1 0 0 0
Row 3: 0 0 0 0 0
```

So:
- Top-left block: all ones connected → one island
- `(1,3)` is isolated from others? No — `(0,3)` → `(1,3)` → yes, connected!

But `(1,3)` is connected to `(0,3)` → which is part of main island → so still one island.

Wait — this is actually **one island**!

But expected output is `1`.

✅ Yes — only **one** connected group of `'1'`.

If we had:
```
["1","1","0"],
["0","0","1"]
```
→ Two islands.

So this example gives `1`.

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(m×n) — each cell visited once
- **Space:** O(m×n) — `visited` array + recursion stack (worst-case depth m×n)

                # Check bounds and if fresh orange
                if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and 
                    grid[nr][nc] == 1):
                    
                    # Rot the orange
                    grid[nr][nc] = 2
                    fresh_count -= 1
                    queue.append((nr, nc))
        
        minutes += 1  # One minute passed
    
    # If any fresh orange remains, return -1
    return minutes if fresh_count == 0 else -1
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
```
[
  [2,1,1],
  [1,1,0],
  [0,1,1]
]
```

**Step-by-step:**
- Rotten oranges: `(0,0)`
- Fresh: 5
- Minute 0: process `(0,0)` → infect `(0,1)` and `(1,0)`
- Minute 1: process `(0,1)`, `(1,0)` → infect `(0,2)`, `(1,1)`
- Minute 2: process `(0,2)`, `(1,1)` → infect `(2,1)`
- Minute 3: process `(2,1)` → no new infections
- All fresh oranges now rotten → return `3`

✅ Output: `3`

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(m×n) — each cell processed once
- **Space:** O(m×n) — queue holds up to all rotten oranges

  - Bus Routes → BFS with routes as graph
  - Cheapest Flights Within K Stops → BFS/Dijkstra with (node, stops) state

- **Backtracking + DFS**
  - Word Search → DFS with visited (already covered in Chunk 1 — skip)
  - Word Search II → DFS + Trie for pruning

> ✅ We'll reprocess **Word Search II** here since it's a more advanced variant.

## 🧩 Pattern: **Topological Sort**
> *Used when tasks have dependencies; output is an ordering where each task comes after its prerequisites.*

#### ✅ How to Recognize:
- Problem involves dependencies: "A must happen before B"
- You’re asked to find an order of execution or detect if impossible
- Graph is **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** — no cycles allowed

#### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (The Recipe):
1. **Build adjacency list and indegree array** from edges.
2. **Find all nodes with indegree 0** → they can start first.
3. **Use queue (Kahn’s Algorithm)**: repeatedly remove indegree 0 nodes.
4. For each removed node, decrease indegree of its neighbors.
5. If all nodes are processed → valid topological order exists.
6. Else → cycle → return empty list.

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases:
- Not checking for cycles → return invalid order.
- Using DFS without proper backtracking → missing nodes.
- Forgetting that multiple valid orders exist → any valid one is acceptable.
- Handling self-loops or duplicate edges.

### 🔍 Summary:
Given `n` courses labeled 0 to n−1 and a list of prerequisite pairs, determine if it's possible to finish all courses.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **Topological Sort (Cycle Detection)**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
from collections import deque

def canFinish(numCourses, prerequisites):
    # Build adjacency list and indegree array
    graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
    indegree = [0] * numCourses
    
    for course, prereq in prerequisites:
        graph[prereq].append(course)  # prereq -> course
        indegree[course] += 1
    
    # Queue for nodes with indegree 0
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(numCourses):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    # Count processed nodes
    processed = 0
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        processed += 1
        
        # Reduce indegree of neighbors
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            indegree[neighbor] -= 1
            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # If all courses processed → no cycle
    return processed == numCourses
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
`numCourses = 2`, `prerequisites = [[1,0]]`

- Course 1 depends on course 0.
- Graph: `0 → 1`
- Indegree: `[0,1]`
- Start: `queue = [0]`
- Process 0 → reduce indegree of 1 → becomes 0 → add to queue
- Process 1 → done
- `processed = 2` → equals `numCourses` → return `True`

✅ Output: `true`

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(V + E) — visit each node and edge once
- **Space:** O(V + E) — graph + indegree + queue

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
from collections import deque

def findOrder(numCourses, prerequisites):
    # Build graph and indegree
    graph = [[] for _ in range(numCourses)]
    indegree = [0] * numCourses
    
    for course, prereq in prerequisites:
        graph[prereq].append(course)
        indegree[course] += 1
    
    # Queue for indegree 0 nodes
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(numCourses):
        if indegree[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)

    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            indegree[neighbor] -= 1
            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Check if all courses are included
    return result if len(result) == numCourses else []
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
`numCourses = 4`, `prerequisites = [[1,0],[2,0],[3,1],[3,2]]`

- Dependencies: 0→1, 0→2, 1→3, 2→3
- Graph: `0 → 1 → 3`, `0 → 2 → 3`
- Indegree: `[0,1,1,2]`
- Start: `queue = [0]`
- Process 0 → update 1 and 2 → both indegree=0 → add to queue
- Process 1 → update 3 → indegree[3]=1
- Process 2 → update 3 → indegree[3]=0 → add to queue
- Process 3 → done
- Result: `[0,1,2,3]`

✅ Output: `[0,1,2,3]` (or any valid order like `[0,2,1,3]`)

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(V + E)

## 📌 Problem 3: [Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given a list of words sorted lexicographically in an alien language, reconstruct the order of characters.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **Topological Sort**
- **Graph Construction from String Comparison**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def alienOrder(words):
    # Step 1: Initialize graph and indegree
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    indegree = {char: 0 for word in words for char in word}
    
    # Step 2: Compare adjacent words to build edges
    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        w1, w2 = words[i], words[i + 1]
        min_len = min(len(w1), len(w2))
        
        found_diff = False
        for j in range(min_len):

                if c2 not in graph[c1]:
                    graph[c1].add(c2)
                    indegree[c2] += 1
                found_diff = True
                break
        
        # If shorter word is prefix of longer → invalid (e.g., "abc" before "ab")
        if not found_diff and len(w1) > len(w2):
            return ""
    
    # Step 3: Kahn’s algorithm

    result = []
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        result.append(node)
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            indegree[neighbor] -= 1
            if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Check if all characters are used
    return ''.join(result) if len(result) == len(indegree) else ""
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `words = ["wrt","wrf","er","ett","rft"]`

- Compare `"wrt"` and `"wrf"` → 't' vs 'f' → add `t → f`
- Compare `"wrf"` and `"er"` → 'w' vs 'e' → add `w → e`
- Compare `"er"` and `"ett"` → 'e' vs 'e', then 'r' vs 't' → add `r → t`
- Compare `"ett"` and `"rft"` → 'e' vs 'r' → add `e → r`

Edges: `t→f`, `w→e`, `r→t`, `e→r`

Graph:
- `w → e`
- `e → r`
- `r → t`
- `t → f`

Indegree: `w:0`, `e:1`, `r:1`, `t:1`, `f:1`

Start: `queue = [w]`
- Process `w` → `e` now indegree 0
- Process `e` → `r` → 0
- Process `r` → `t` → 0
- Process `t` → `f` → 0
- Process `f`

Result: `"wertf"`

✅ Output: `"wertf"` (or valid permutation)

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(C) where C = total characters across all words
- **Space:** O(1) — at most 26 letters, so constant

## 🧩 Pattern: **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union)**
> *Used to manage disjoint sets, detect cycles, merge groups, count components.*

#### ✅ How to Recognize:
- Problems about connected components, merging groups, detecting cycles in undirected graphs.
- You're told to “merge” or “union” things, or check if two items are connected.

#### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (The Recipe):
1. **Initialize parent and rank arrays** (each node points to itself).
2. **Find root with path compression** (`find(x)`).
3. **Union by rank** (`union(x,y)`): attach smaller tree under larger.
4. Use `union` to connect components.
5. Use `find` to check connectivity or detect cycles.

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases:
- Not using path compression/rank → slow performance.
- Incorrect union logic (e.g., always attaching x to y).
- Not handling self-loops or duplicate edges.
- Returning wrong result (e.g., returning `True` when union fails due to cycle).

        # Link all emails in this account
        for email in emails:
            email_to_name[email] = name
            uf.union(emails[0], email)  # link all to first email
    
    # Step 2: Group emails by their root parent
    groups = defaultdict(list)
    for email in email_to_name:

    result = []
    for group in groups.values():
        result.append([email_to_name[group[0]]] + sorted(group))
    
    return result
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
```
accounts = [["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john_newyork@mail.com"],
            ["John","johnsmith@mail.com","john00@mail.com"],
            ["Mary","mary@mail.com"]]
```

- John’s emails: `johnsmith@mail.com`, `john_newyork@mail.com`, `john00@mail.com`
- First account: union `johnsmith` ↔ `john_newyork`
- Second account: union `johnsmith` ↔ `john00` → so all three linked
- Mary: standalone

Groups:
- Root of johnsmith → all three emails grouped
- Mary → her own

Output:
```
[
  ["John", "john00@mail.com", "john_newyork@mail.com", "johnsmith@mail.com"],
  ["Mary", "mary@mail.com"]
]
```

✅ Correct.

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(A × M × α(M)) where A = accounts, M = avg emails per account, α = inverse Ackermann
- **Space:** O(E) — number of emails

        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True

def validTree(n, edges):

    for u, v, w in flights:
        graph[u].append((v, w))
    
    # Min-heap: (cost, stops, node)
    heap = [(0, 0, src)]
    min_cost = [float('inf')] * n
    
    while heap:
        cost, stops, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        if node == dst:
            return cost
        
        if stops > k:
            continue
        
        if cost > min_cost[node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, flight_cost in graph[node]:
            new_cost = cost + flight_cost
            new_stops = stops + 1
            
            if new_cost < min_cost[neighbor]:
                min_cost[neighbor] = new_cost
                heapq.heappush(heap, (new_cost, new_stops, neighbor))
    
    return -1
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `n = 3`, `flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]]`, `src = 0`, `dst = 2`, `k = 1`

- 0→1→2: cost = 200, stops = 1 → valid
- 0→2: cost = 500, stops = 0 → but only 1 stop allowed → valid
- Min = 200

✅ Output: `200`

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(E × log V × (K+1)) — each edge may be pushed multiple times
- **Space:** O(V + E)

## 📌 Problem 11: [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given a board and list of words, return all words found in the board.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **Trie + DFS with Backtracking**
- **Pruning via Prefix Matching**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.word = None  # store full word at leaf

        # Mark visited
        board[r][c] = '#'
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and 
                board[nr][nc] != '#'):
                dfs(nr, nc, current_node)
        
        # Backtrack
        board[r][c] = char
    
    # Try starting from every cell
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            dfs(i, j, trie.root)
    
    return list(result)
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

## 🔷 Chunk 3: Dynamic Programming on Graphs

We’ll now cover the following two advanced problems that combine **Graph Traversal** with **Dynamic Programming**:

- [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)  
- [Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/)

These are excellent examples of **DP on graphs**, where we use memoization or iterative pruning (like topological sort) to solve path optimization problems.

---

## 🧩 Pattern: **Dynamic Programming on Graphs**
> *Used when you need to compute optimal paths, longest/shortest sequences, or values that depend on neighbors — often with constraints like monotonicity.*

#### ✅ How to Recognize:
- Problem involves a grid or graph where each node has a value.
- You're asked to find the **longest increasing path**, **minimum height tree**, or similar.
- The solution depends on values of neighboring nodes (e.g., `current > neighbor`).
- Recursion with memoization is natural → avoid recomputation.

#### 📝 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (The Recipe):
1. **Define state**: What does `dp[i][j]` represent? (e.g., longest path starting at `(i,j)`)
2. **Base case**: If no valid next step → return 1.
3. **Transition**: For each neighbor, if condition holds (e.g., `matrix[i][j] < neighbor`), take max of `1 + dp[neighbor]`.
4. **Memoize**: Cache results to avoid recalculating.
5. **Iterate over all starting points** and return maximum.

#### ⚠️ Common Pitfalls & Edge Cases:
- Forgetting to **memoize** → exponential time.
- Misunderstanding directionality (e.g., increasing vs decreasing).
- Not handling edge cases like single cell, or all equal values.
- Using recursion without stack limit awareness (use iterative DP or increase recursion limit if needed).

---

## 📌 Problem 1: [Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given an `m x n` matrix of integers, find the length of the longest increasing path where you can only move up/down/left/right, and each step must go to a strictly larger number.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **DFS + Memoization**
- **DP on Grid**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
def longestIncreasingPath(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    
    # Memoization cache: dp[r][c] = longest path starting at (r,c)
    memo = {}
    
    # Directions: up, down, left, right
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    
    def dfs(r, c):
        # If already computed, return cached result
        if (r, c) in memo:
            return memo[(r, c)]
        
        # Base case: start with path length 1 (just current cell)
        max_length = 1
        
        # Try all 4 neighbors
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            
            # Check bounds and increasing condition
            if (0 <= nr < rows and 0 <= nc < cols and 
                matrix[nr][nc] > matrix[r][c]):
                
                # Recursively compute path from neighbor
                length = 1 + dfs(nr, nc)
                max_length = max(max_length, length)
        
        # Cache result
        memo[(r, c)] = max_length
        return max_length
    
    # Try starting from every cell
    result = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            result = max(result, dfs(i, j))
    
    return result
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
```
matrix = [
  [9,9,4],
  [6,6,8],
  [2,1,1]
]
```

**Step-by-step:**
- Start at `(0,0)` = 9 → can’t go anywhere → path = 1
- Start at `(0,1)` = 9 → same
- Start at `(0,2)` = 4 → go to `(1,2)` = 8 → then to `(1,1)` = 6? No → 8 > 6 → invalid
  - But wait: `4 → 8` → `8 → ?` → nothing bigger → path = 2
- Start at `(1,0)` = 6 → go to `(1,1)` = 6 → not greater → skip
- Start at `(1,1)` = 6 → no outgoing
- Start at `(1,2)` = 8 → go to `(0,2)` = 4 → smaller → invalid
- Start at `(2,0)` = 2 → go to `(1,0)` = 6 → good → then to `(0,0)` = 9 → good → then stop
  - Path: `2 → 6 → 9` → length = 3
- Also: `2 → 6 → 8` → length = 3
- So max = 3

✅ Output: `3`

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(m×n) — each cell computed once due to memoization
- **Space:** O(m×n) — memoization table + recursion stack (depth ≤ m×n)

## 📌 Problem 2: [Minimum Height Trees](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-height-trees/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given an undirected tree (graph with n nodes and n−1 edges), find all **root nodes** such that the tree's height is minimized.

> A "height" of a tree is the longest path from root to any leaf.

### 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **BFS (Topological Sort-like)** — trimming leaves iteratively
- **Graph DP / Greedy Pruning**
- **Tree Center Finding**

### ✅ Solution with Inline Comments:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def findMinHeightTrees(n, edges):
    # Handle base case
    if n == 1:
        return [0]
    
    # Build adjacency list and degree array
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    degree = [0] * n
    
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].add(v)
        graph[v].add(u)
        degree[u] += 1
        degree[v] += 1
    
    # Queue for leaf nodes (degree = 1)
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if degree[i] == 1:
            queue.append(i)
    
    remaining_nodes = n
    # Trim leaves layer by layer until 1 or 2 nodes remain
    while remaining_nodes > 2:
        # Remove current level of leaves
        leaves_count = len(queue)
        remaining_nodes -= leaves_count
        
        for _ in range(leaves_count):
            leaf = queue.popleft()
            
            # Remove leaf from its neighbor
            for neighbor in graph[leaf]:
                degree[neighbor] -= 1
                graph[neighbor].remove(leaf)
                
                # If neighbor becomes leaf, add it
                if degree[neighbor] == 1:
                    queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Remaining nodes are centers (min height roots)
    return list(queue)
```

### 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:** `n = 6`, `edges = [[3,0],[3,1],[3,2],[3,4],[5,4]]`

Graph:
```
     0   1   2
      \ | /
        3
       / \
      4   5
```

- Leaves: 0,1,2,5 → degree 1
- First round: remove 0,1,2,5 → update neighbors
  - Node 3 loses 3 connections → degree becomes 1
  - Node 4 loses one connection (5) → still degree 1
- Now leaves: 3,4 → both have degree 1
- Remaining nodes: 2 → stop
- Return `[3,4]`

But wait: `remaining_nodes > 2` → continue?

Let’s simulate:
- Initial: degree = [1,1,1,4,1,1]
- Queue: [0,1,2,5]
- Remove them → reduce degree of 3 and 4 → degree[3]=1, degree[4]=0? Wait:

Wait: edge `5-4` → so removing 5 → reduces degree of 4 from 2 to 1  
Edge `3-0`, `3-1`, `3-2` → remove 0,1,2 → degree[3] goes from 4 → 1

So after first round:
- degree: [0,0,0,1,1,0]
- Queue: [3,4]

Now `remaining_nodes = 2` → break loop

Return `[3,4]`

✅ Output: `[3,4]`

This makes sense — center nodes minimize height.

### 📊 Complexity:
- **Time:** O(n) — each edge processed once
- **Space:** O(n) — graph, degree, queue

## Problem 3: [Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/)

### 🔍 Summary:
Given a reference to a node in a connected undirected graph, return a deep copy (clone) of the graph. Each node has a `val` and a list of its neighbors.

> This is a classic **graph traversal + hashing** problem using **DFS or BFS** with a **visited map**.

---

## 🎯 Pattern(s):
- **Graph Traversal (DFS/BFS)**
- **Hash Map for Cloning (Node → Clone Mapping)**
- **Deep Copy**

---

## 🧩 Why It Fits Your List:
- It's a **core graph problem** like others you've done.
- Requires **handling adjacency lists** and **avoiding cycles** via visited tracking.
- Perfect fit for **DFS + memoization** or **BFS + queue**.

---

## 🧠 Step-by-Step Thinking Process (The Recipe):

1. Use a **hash map** (`old_to_new`) to store mapping from original node to its clone.
2. Start from the given node.
3. If already cloned → return the clone.
4. Otherwise:
   - Create a new node with same `val`.
   - Add to map.
   - Recursively clone all neighbors.
5. Return the cloned node.

> ⚠️ Key insight: **Don’t re-create nodes you’ve already cloned** → avoid infinite loops.

---

## 🛠️ Solution Template (DFS + Memoization)

```python
# Definition for a Node.
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val=0, neighbors=None):
        self.val = val
        self.neighbors = neighbors if neighbors is not None else []

def cloneGraph(node):
    # Hash map: original node -> cloned node
    old_to_new = {}
    
    def dfs(n):
        # Base case: if already cloned, return it
        if n in old_to_new:
            return old_to_new[n]
        
        # Create new node
        clone = Node(n.val)
        old_to_new[n] = clone  # mark as cloned
        
        # Clone all neighbors
        for neighbor in n.neighbors:
            clone.neighbors.append(dfs(neighbor))
        
        return clone
    
    return dfs(node) if node else None
```

> ✅ **Time:** O(V + E) — each node and edge processed once  
> ✅ **Space:** O(V) — hash map + recursion stack

---

## 🧪 Official Example Walkthrough:

**Input:**  
`node = 1`, neighbors: `[2,4]`  
`node 2`: neighbors: `[1,3]`  
`node 3`: neighbors: `[2,4]`  
`node 4`: neighbors: `[1,3]`

This forms a cycle: `1–2–3–4–1`

**Steps:**
1. Start at `node 1`
2. Create clone of `1` → `new_1`
3. Clone `2` → `new_2`, then clone `3` → `new_3`, then clone `4` → `new_4`
4. All connections are preserved in new graph
5. Return `new_1`

✅ Output: Deep copy of the graph

# 📚 **LeetCode Interview Cheat Sheet: 10 Core Patterns + Templates**

> ✅ Designed for rapid review before interviews  
> 🔥 Covers **Graphs, DP, BFS/DFS, Topo Sort, Union-Find**, and more  
> 📌 Each pattern includes:
- How to recognize
- Step-by-step thinking recipe
- Common pitfalls
- Code template (Python)
- Example walkthrough (from real problems)

---

## 🔷 1. **DFS / BFS on Grid**
### ✅ Recognize:
- 2D grid (`matrix`, `board`)
- Flood fill, island counting, shortest path in unweighted grid

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Check bounds & visited state
2. Base case: invalid or visited → return
3. Mark current cell as visited
4. Recursively visit neighbors
5. Return result (count, path, etc.)

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Stack overflow (use iterative BFS for large grids)
- Forgetting to mark visited → infinite loop
- Wrong movement directions (4 vs 8)

### 🛠️ Template (DFS):
```python
def dfs(grid, r, c, visited):
    if (r < 0 or r >= len(grid) or 
        c < 0 or c >= len(grid[0]) or
        grid[r][c] == '0' or (r,c) in visited):
        return
    
    visited.add((r,c))
    # Do work here
    for dr, dc in [(0,1),(0,-1),(1,0),(-1,0)]:
        dfs(grid, r+dr, c+dc, visited)
```

### 🧪 Example: [Number of Islands](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-islands/)  
→ Count connected `'1'` groups using DFS.

---

## 🔷 2. **Multi-source BFS**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Shortest distance to nearest target (e.g., `0`s)
- Multiple starting points (e.g., all rotten oranges, all sources)
- Unweighted graph/grid

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Add all sources to queue with distance 0
2. Process level by level (BFS)
3. Update neighbor distances only if better
4. Stop when queue empty

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Not initializing distances properly
- Revisiting nodes without checking improvement

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
queue = deque()
dist = [[float('inf')] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
for each source:
    queue.append((r, c))
    dist[r][c] = 0

while queue:
    r, c = queue.popleft()
    for dr, dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
        if valid and dist[nr][nc] > dist[r][c] + 1:
            dist[nr][nc] = dist[r][c] + 1
            queue.append((nr, nc))
```

### 🧪 Example: [01 Matrix](https://leetcode.com/problems/01-matrix/)  
→ Find distance to nearest `0`.

---

## 🔷 3. **Topological Sort (Kahn’s Algorithm)**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Tasks with dependencies ("A must come before B")
- Detect cycle or find valid order
- Graph is directed

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Build graph + indegree array
2. Queue all nodes with indegree 0
3. Remove node → reduce indegree of neighbors
4. If all nodes processed → no cycle → valid order

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Not handling self-loops
- Returning invalid order when cycle exists
- Forgetting to check `len(result) == n`

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
indegree = [0] * n
for u, v in edges:
    graph[u].append(v)
    indegree[v] += 1

queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if indegree[i] == 0])
result = []

while queue:
    u = queue.popleft()
    result.append(u)
    for v in graph[u]:
        indegree[v] -= 1
        if indegree[v] == 0:
            queue.append(v)

return result if len(result) == n else []
```

### 🧪 Examples:
- [Course Schedule](https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule/)
- [Alien Dictionary](https://leetcode.com/problems/alien-dictionary/)

---

## 🔷 4. **Union-Find (DSU)**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Connected components
- Cycle detection in undirected graphs
- Merge groups (e.g., accounts, islands)

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Initialize parent and rank arrays
2. Use `find(x)` with path compression
3. Use `union(x,y)` by rank
4. Use `find` to check connectivity

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Not using path compression/rank → slow
- Incorrect union logic (e.g., always attach x to y)

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        px, py = self.find(x), self.find(y)
        if px == py:
            return False
        if self.rank[px] < self.rank[py]:
            px, py = py, px
        self.parent[py] = px
        if self.rank[px] == self.rank[py]:
            self.rank[px] += 1
        return True
```

### 🧪 Examples:
- [Accounts Merge](https://leetcode.com/problems/accounts-merge/)
- [Graph Valid Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/graph-valid-tree/)

---

## 🔷 5. **Shortest Path (BFS/Dijkstra)**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Minimum steps/distance in weighted/unweighted graph
- Constraints: max stops, limited moves

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
- **Unweighted**: BFS (queue)
- **Weighted**: Dijkstra (min-heap)
- Track state: `(node, steps, cost)`
- Prune if worse than best known

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Using BFS for weighted graphs → wrong answer
- Not tracking state (e.g., stops, cost)

### 🛠️ Template (Dijkstra):
```python
heapq.heappush(heap, (cost, node))
while heap:
    cost, node = heapq.heappop(heap)
    if cost > min_cost[node]: continue
    for neighbor, w in graph[node]:
        new_cost = cost + w
        if new_cost < min_cost[neighbor]:
            min_cost[neighbor] = new_cost
            heapq.heappush(heap, (new_cost, neighbor))
```

### 🧪 Examples:
- [Word Ladder](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-ladder/)
- [Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://leetcode.com/problems/cheapest-flights-within-k-stops/)

---

## 🔷 6. **Backtracking + DFS**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Search for combinations/subsets/permutations
- "Try all paths" — e.g., word search, Sudoku
- One cell used once per path

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Try placing item at current position
2. Recurse
3. Backtrack: restore state
4. Avoid revisiting same path

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Not marking/unmarking visited → incorrect results
- Exponential time → optimize with pruning

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
def backtrack(path, choices):
    if goal_reached:
        result.append(path[:])
        return
    
    for choice in choices:
        path.append(choice)
        backtrack(path, remaining_choices)
        path.pop()  # backtracking
```

### 🧪 Example: [Word Search II](https://leetcode.com/problems/word-search-ii/)  
→ Use Trie + DFS + backtracking

---

## 🔷 7. **Dynamic Programming on Graphs**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Longest increasing path
- Optimal path based on values
- Recursive dependency on neighbors

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Define `dp[r][c]` = longest path starting at `(r,c)`
2. Base: 1 (just current cell)
3. Recursion: `max(1 + dp[neighbor])` if condition holds
4. Memoize to avoid recomputation

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- No memoization → exponential time
- Wrong direction (increasing vs decreasing)

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
memo = {}
def dfs(r, c):
    if (r,c) in memo: return memo[(r,c)]
    max_len = 1
    for dr,dc in directions:
        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
        if valid and matrix[nr][nc] > matrix[r][c]:
            max_len = max(max_len, 1 + dfs(nr, nc))
    memo[(r,c)] = max_len
    return max_len
```

## 🔷 8. **Tree Center / Minimum Height Trees**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Find root(s) that minimize tree height
- Only works on trees (acyclic undirected graphs)

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Trim leaves layer by layer
2. Until 1–2 nodes remain
3. These are the centers

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Not handling base case (n=1)
- Misunderstanding “height” definition

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
queue = deque([i for i in range(n) if degree[i] == 1])
while len(nodes) > 2:
    size = len(queue)
    for _ in range(size):
        leaf = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in graph[leaf]:
            degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if degree[neighbor] == 1:
                queue.append(neighbor)
return list(queue)
```

## 🔷 9. **Trie + DFS (Word Search II)**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Multiple words to search in grid
- Prefix-based pruning needed

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Build Trie from all words
2. DFS from each cell
3. Prune if prefix not in Trie
4. Collect full words when found

### ⚠️ Pitfalls:
- Not storing full word at leaf
- Not removing duplicates (use set)

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self): self.children = {}; self.word = None

def insert(root, word):
    node = root
    for c in word:
        if c not in node.children:
            node.children[c] = TrieNode()
        node = node.children[c]
    node.word = word

def dfs(board, i, j, node, result):
    char = board[i][j]
    if char not in node.children: return
    node = node.children[char]
    if node.word:
        result.add(node.word)
    board[i][j] = '#'
    for di, dj in directions:
        ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
        if 0<=ni<m and 0<=nj<n and board[ni][nj]!='#':
            dfs(board, ni, nj, node, result)
    board[i][j] = char
```

## 🔷 10. **Symmetry Optimization (e.g., Knight Moves)**
### ✅ Recognize:
- Infinite grid
- Symmetric solution space
- Can reduce search to one quadrant

### 🧠 Thinking Process:
1. Use absolute coordinates
2. Mirror negative indices
3. Limit search space (e.g., `x+2`, `y+2`)
4. BFS with symmetry

### 🛠️ Template:
```python
x, y = abs(x), abs(y)
queue = deque([(0,0,0)])
visited = {(0,0)}
while queue:
    r, c, steps = queue.popleft()
    if r == x and c == y: return steps
    for dr,dc in knight_moves:
        nr, nc = r+dr, c+dc
        nr, nc = abs(nr), abs(nc)
        if (nr,nc) not in visited and nr <= x+2 and nc <= y+2:
            visited.add((nr,nc))
            queue.append((nr,nc,steps+1))
```
